This is the begining of a what is not common in the blockchain space - A web3 betting/prediction App.

The Dapp will be 100% decentralized when it is ready and will give each users control over what he can predict or what should be predicted.
Some of the features of the Dapp are;
- Risk Free betting space
- Earn a token for creating a bet, a prediction... e.t.c
- Predict/Vote without staking any of your money and get a token for doing that
- No Centralized control of the betting odds
- and more...

But that's just a little of what you can do with the DAPP; We have a lot in store.
We are still building the Dapp. So far, we have created a prototype for the Hackathon and hope we can get Funds for taking this DAPP to a level beyond the conventional centralized betting platforms.

The prototype can be accessed here https://hibet.vercel.app/
We have the UI/UX design also @ https://www.figma.com/proto/pYxYn2KDStOlwZrpJeVpkB/HiBet?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=20%3A41&viewport=460%2C200%2C0.25&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=2%3A2

Any contribution, suggestion will be appreciated.
